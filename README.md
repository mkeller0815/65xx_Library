65xx_Library
============

## 1.0 About

Mainly this is an approach to create a KiCad Library for the most 65xx 
parts, like the 6502 CPU, the 6522 VIA and others.

There are also some useful chip labels for print out

## 2.0 KiCad Library

KiCad can be found under:

This Library can be found in the KiCad folder

## 3.0 Chip Label

Additionally I've created some labels that can be glued on the top of an IC for easier wiring. 
The Labels are created as SVG file and exported to a PNG and PDF version. 

The folder "ChipLabel" contains the files.
